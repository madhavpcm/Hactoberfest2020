					<div id="demotext"><p>As health officials race to get the word out on how to slow the coronavirus outbreak, you’ve likely heard the phrase “flatten the curve” . <br /> But what does that mean, and does it even work? 

						<br />The curve everyone's talking about is a projection of the number of people who contract COVID–19 over a period of time. The graph represents the number of people who have the disease, on the y-axis (vertical), for each day since the first case, on the x-axis (horizontal). 
						
						A high curve is created by a steep increase in the number of cases per day followed by a quick decrease. <br /> A flatter curve is created by a more gradual increase in the number of cases per day and a more gradual decrease. 
						
						<br />Over a long period of time, the number of people infected with the novel coronavirus might be about the same, but the difference is in the number of cases each day. This means that the limited healthcare facilities we have in the real world can reach more people and save more lives. </b>	 </p></div>
